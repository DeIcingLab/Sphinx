    "**Abstract:** Electro-mechanical de-icing systems are low-energy ice protection solutions based on ice fracture mechanisms. This article focuses on resonant electro-mechanical de-icing systems that actuate modes of flexion, which require low energy compared to extension modes. However, fracture propagation limits are encountered when using such flexural modes, preventing the ice from being completely detached from the substrate. This study demonstrates the feasibility of extending the ice detachment area by optimizing the thickness of the substrate. First, the interest and the limits of flexural resonant modes are discussed. Then the de-icing of a simple metallic beam in free conditions using a flexural mode is improved owing to the parametric optimization of the substrate thickness. The optimization is verified by tests on aluminum prototypes. The optimization results are then extended to a clamped composite plate and then to a NACA profile, showing interest in the approach to fully de-ice structures with modes of flexion, even in the case of complex geometries. With this last example, the study also demonstrates the feasibility of electro-mechanical ice protection systems for carbon fiber reinforced Polymer composite structures.\n",

    "**Abstract:** Piezoelectric materials are employed in several different aerospace applications thanks to their actuating and sensing abilities. They can be adopted to control vibration, stress distribution, aeroelastic stability, shape changes, and in structural health monitoring systems. Given the level of reliability required in aeronautics, it is of vital importance to ensure their correct functioning during all aircraft life and for critical events such as impacts. This paper proposes a novel test standard method to measure and qualify the damage resistance of smart PZT structures to a drop-weight impact event. Procedures for the quantification of damage through measurements of electromechanical characteristics are introduced and verified by impact tests.\n"
